# ms-chess
a microservice-based chess rules engine.  This is for Part 3 of a series in freecodecamp.

## running tests
first, make sure to run ```npm install```, but first check that NODE_ENV is not set to production (or dev modules won't get installed).

second, run ```mocha test```

If any test fails to pass, let me know.
